# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis
## Module 7 Challenge

## Background 
This challenge was created to analyze Pewlett=Hackard's "silver tsunami" or major wave of retiring employees and to help identify employees who would be eligible to participte in a company sponsored mentorship program.  There were 6 unique data tables provided and then tables needed to be created in PostgreSQL to complete the challenge.

## Analysis
-Deliverable 1 indicates that more than almost 3 times as many staff in senior roles  will be retiring as compared to other department titles.  
-Senior Engineers will be the department hit the highest by retiring staff.
-By comparing the mentor eligible to the number of staff retiring it does not appear that the company will have enough qualified employees for the senior roles opening in the future.
-Deliverable 2 has determined that there are more than 1500 employees eligible for mentorship. Many of these employees are listed as Senior Staff Engineers.

## Summary
With approximately 50,000 senior staff set to retire, it does not appear that the mentorship of approximately 1500 employees will even come close to filling the expertise void that will soon develop at Pewlett Hackard.  It may require some additional analysis to determine the number of employees that may have the skills necessary to help the company continue to conduct successful business in the future.
